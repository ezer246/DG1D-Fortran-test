f(x) = A*sin(2*pi*f*x+phi)*exp(-gamma*x)

Each fit has two iterations. One fit to obtain the rough exponent and
one fit of the data divided by the exp(-gammaFit*x) to obtain a more
accurate second pass set of fit parameters. Therefore, there are two
fits in the log per entry in the table. They appear in the log in the
same order as in the table. Within a pair, the total gamma is obtained
through straight addition as is the error on gamma.


It was not possible to obtain acceptable fits of the zeroth harmonic
data due to the warped shape of the oscillations (introductions of
overtones).
